# **Summary**
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of telecom customer churn using Python and SQL. Key preprocessing steps included cleaning the data, engineering features such as complaints and call duration, and converting categorical fields using one-hot encoding. A Random Forest classifier was used to predict churn, and feature importance was interpreted using ELI5 and SHAP. Customers were segmented into three groups—Loyal, At Risk, and Dormant—based on churn probability. SQL-based analysis provided further insights into revenue, tenure, and complaints across segments. Visualizations and detailed outputs were generated, enabling business stakeholders to understand churn patterns and act on retention strategies effectively.

"""# **Conclusion**
The analysis identified tenure, monthly charges, and customer engagement factors like complaints as top churn predictors. Dormant customers exhibited the highest churn probability, low tenure, and increased complaint frequency, indicating a strong need for proactive retention strategies. Loyal customers, in contrast, showed high tenure and low churn risk. By integrating machine learning with SQL insights, this project delivers actionable intelligence to reduce churn and increase customer lifetime value. Future recommendations include targeted outreach for high-risk segments and improving service satisfaction through personalized support. This framework can serve as a scalable solution for ongoing customer lifecycle and churn management.
